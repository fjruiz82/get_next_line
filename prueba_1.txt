A Function to Read From the File Descriptor

This function will read from the file descriptor in a loop until we detect a \n or the end of the file:

    create a reading loop that stops when the read function returns 0, which means we are at the end of the file and there is nothing left to read,
        read from the file descriptor,
        if read returns -1, there was an error, free all allocated memory and stop everything,
        save the read characters in a static variable (strjoin the buffer to the static),
        check to see if there is a \n in the static variable: if yes, stop the loop, if no, continue.
